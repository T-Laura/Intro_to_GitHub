GitHub will be a useful tool in creating a portfolio. You can store various projects on one branch, while having information about yourself on another branch. This will help organize the information that should be seen.
GitHub also allows going back through projects. You can go back to a previous commit to see how much work is done each time. This can show how quickly you can complete various tasks.
