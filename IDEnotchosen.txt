One of the IDE's that I chose not to use is JDoodle. I already had an alternate IDE that worked for Java. Going through the effort to install the IDE didn't seem useful since I already had an IDE on my computer. I will almost certainly be using only my current computer to create the code for this class in the lessons ahead so having one that could work over multiple computers didn't seem reasonable.
